      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>Tic Tac Toe game is a classic game that can be easily developed in Python programming language. The game typically involves creating a 3x3 grid, where each cell represents a possible move. The two players take turns placing their symbols (typically "X" and "O") on the grid until one of the players achieves a win or the game ends in a tie.

To develop a Tic Tac Toe game in Python, we can create a 2D list that represents the game board. Each cell in the list can be initialized to a space character (" ") to represent an empty cell. We can then use a loop to alternate between the two players and prompt them to input the row and column of the cell they want to mark.

After each turn, we can check if either player has won by checking for three in a row in any row, column, or diagonal. If a win is detected, we can print a message declaring the winner and end the game. If all cells are filled and no win is detected, we can declare the game a tie.</p>
